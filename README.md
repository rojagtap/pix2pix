# pix2pix
A U-NET + PatchGAN based architecture to generate enhanced pictures from given skeletons
 
This project demonstrates image to image translation using conditional GAN's, as described in [Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004) . Using this technique we can colorize black and white photos, convert google maps to google earth, etc. Here, we convert building facades to real buildings.
